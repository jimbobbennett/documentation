## Pieces Copilot

Open the copilot using the Pieces View from the Ribbon Menu, and select the bot logo on the top slider to switch to Copilot

- Interact with the Pieces Copilot and receive answers that are specific to your notebooks.
- You can 'Ask Copilot' about a specific piece of code by highlighting it in a cell, right-clicking, and clicking on 'Ask Pieces about your selection'
- [A familiar chat experience spread across all your favorite text editing software](/features/pieces-copilot#plugin-integrations)
    - The Copilot chat window has the same familiar features integrated into multiple text editing softwares: VS Code, JetBrains, Visual Studio, Web Extension, Obsidian, and JupyterLab.

### Enrich Selected Code

Select any text within a code cell in your notebook, right-click, and the Copilot will add a helpful comment at the top describing your code.

### Realtime Streaming

Any changes you make across any Pieces integration (e.g., the Pieces Desktop App, the Pieces VS Code Extension, the Pieces JetBrains Plugin, etc.) will automatically be reflected in the JupyterLab extension. This means all your copilot chats and saved materials will automatically be available across all your apps that integrate with Pieces.
